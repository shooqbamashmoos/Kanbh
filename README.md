# Kanbh 
is the first project that I worked on from the beginning ,I tried to make it a different furniture store, 
you can take a look at my coding disasters and how I struggled with it for a while but in the end, I got it working!

I hope that helps you if you were trying to work on something working with HTML, CSS, or PHP.

hoping my skills improve after this project.
